# Hello, I am Anya :woman_technologist:
### *and here is something about me...*

Looking at how technology is evolving and how different fields embrace innovations, I am excited about all interesting projects I can explore and contibute. It fuels my curiosity to learn more and keeps me humble.

As a developer, I like to apply the KISS design principle in every project. Following the “Keep it simple stupid” strategy helps in developing a great solution that can be easily understood by users and other developers. I also take adaptability and scalability into consideration.

My past experiences taught me how to work with clients and determine their goals. Throughout the project timeline, I engaged in creative and administrative aspects of product development.

Over the years, my work helped me grow my potential and explore new perspectives. All in all, I enjoy creating valuable products that are focused on user experience.

Would love to connect with you on [🔗LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nguyenanya/).
