# Hello, I am Anya :woman_technologist:
### *and here is something about me...*

🛫Years ago I took a risk and left my home country and my parent’s house to build my own life. I moved to a new country where I didn’t know anyone, to pursue a career I wasn’t sure I would like. It was the best decision I made for myself.

👩‍🎓📚When I was studying for my new career I learned that my love for solving puzzles can be useful in my profession. My passion for travelling and exploring new places and cultures taught me to think out of the box and be flexible.

👩‍💻I graduated in 2017 and started my career journey. I worked and learned how to work with clients, and how to manage projects. I learned design techniques and how to use design software to create final products. I worked with tools like Wordpress, shopify, wix, Squarespace, Salesforce, Mailchimp and Adobe. My tech stack includes HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, liquid and AMPscript.

🧘‍♀️Same way I am enthusiastic about self-care to make myself feel better I am motivated to continue learning and improve as a professional.

Let’s connect and support each other👍

Would love to connect with you on [🔗LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nguyenanya/).
